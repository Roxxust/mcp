local rust mcp server designed to easily implement new tools.

create a new tool in /tools and add the router block/line in main.rs and mod.rs  using the boilerplate_example.rs to structure the tool.
tool args are defined in the code.
sloppy/simple approach but seems to work

replace insertnamehere in the path with yours in the mcp.json for lm studio(needs to be double slashed) 

.exe doesn't need to be running, just needs to exist at the path.
