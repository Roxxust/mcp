local rust mcp server designed to easily implement new tools.

create a new tool in /tools and add the router block/line in main.rs and mod.rs  using the boilerplate_example.rs to structure the tool.

sloppy/simple approach but seems to work | replacing my command path with yours in the mcp.json for lm studio, needs to be double slashed | .exe doesn't need to be running, just needs to exist at the path.
tool args defined in the code.
